# Shake-phone-to-increase-screen-brightness
If you've set the brightness too low and you cannot see your screen in the sun, simply shake your phone to increase the screen brightness to maximum. It will not work if your screen is turned off (for example if phone locked).  Note 1: first after install you need to long tap on app icon and select app info, and there you should allow the only permission it requires (= system settings permission) and you can disable notifications as they are not used yet in these early versions and right now they are useless (just a placeholder kind of). Then you need to start app so it actually starts working and the phone should say "App started" through its speakers (have your volume for media turned high to hear that).  Note 2: This app does not have a visual interface, when started it will run in the background, to start it automatically with each boot you can use an auto start app for example this one: Link
